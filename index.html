            Today, the headquarters of a lot of big tech companies are placed in

            Each summer, students apply for tech internships to perform an internship 
            over summer, and those who are offered an internship opportunity receive a 
            chance to consider working for the company he or she received an offer from.

            While making a decision, students take a lot of factors into 
            consideration: prestige, pay, responsibilities, perks, etc.  
            However, one factor that weigh one of the highest in making the 
            decision is housing – whether they are provided with a corporate housing, 
            how much they would be provided with otherwise, and how much the houses are 
            in the region.

            In order to help students determine the price of a house in Seattle, WA 
            based on attributes of a house they are looking for, we have decided to 
            create an application that would predict the price of a house based on 
            their inputs of the attributes of a house sought.
